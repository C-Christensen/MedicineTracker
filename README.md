# MedicineTracker

PillSchedule is a medicine tracker app that helps users to keep track of their medicine intake. It also has a diary activity, where the user can record any type of information such as symptoms, or anything related to the medicine being taken. Finally, the third activity is a map that can be used to locate drugstores.

The app has an uncomplicated and efficient user interface. In the application main page, the user has access to information such as medicine name, quantity, type and the date/time the data was recorded. The data is stored in an SQLite database.

When the user saves the activity (by clicking on the icon located in the upright corner), the new data is displayed on the main page and a toast message can be seen to let the user know the medicine has been saved. The user can also choose to cancel the activity by clicking on the up left corner icon.
